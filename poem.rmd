Upon a gentle breeze,   
A quiet, peaceful scene unfolds.   
Sunlight dances through the trees,   
Where nature’s story beautifully holds.   
A butterfly, with wings so bright,   
Flutters by, a flash of grace.   
A bird sings softly, taking flight,   
In this tranquil, serene space.   
The ferns lie still, in depths of green,   
Beneath the forest’s leafy gleam.   
A hidden peace, seldom seen,   
Found within a simple dream.   
No need for haste, or loud demands,   
Just stillness, in nature’s calm embrace.   
Here, in these quiet, peaceful lands,   
My soul finds solace, and sweet grace.
